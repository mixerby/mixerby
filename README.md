# Hi, I'm NVSM ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Python developer with experience in smart contract development and a strong interest in blockchain technologies and EVM ecosystems.  
I also work as a bug bounty hunter, always looking for vulnerabilities and improving security in decentralized applications.

Constantly exploring new tools and techniques to craft efficient, secure, and scalable code.
